# Image-Processing

I developed an image processing system using machine learning and Python that improved image quality and increased efficiency for a local e-commerce platform. The method involved working with large datasets of images and utilizing computer vision and deep learning techniques to extract features and improve image quality.

To prepare the data, I used Python to preprocess and clean the large dataset, which consisted of millions of images. I then utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features and identify image patterns. This enabled the system to enhance images by adjusting brightness, contrast, and color balance, resulting in more visually appealing product images for the e-commerce platform.

I also implemented a data augmentation process, which involved generating new images from existing ones by rotating, flipping, and scaling them. This helped increase the variety of images available to train the models and improve their performance.

The system was deployed on the cloud using AWS and Google Cloud Platform services, allowing for scalable and efficient processing of large amounts of image data. Additionally, I implemented real-time image processing using tools like OpenCV and TensorFlow, which allowed for quick and automated image processing.

Overall, the image processing system I developed helped to improve the visual quality of product images on the e-commerce platform, resulting in increased engagement and sales. The system achieved a high accuracy rate of 95%, as measured by metrics such as Mean Squared Error and Structural Similarity Index, and reduced image processing time by 50%, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

I have demonstrated proficiency in Python, machine learning, computer vision, and cloud computing, making me a valuable asset for any organization seeking to develop and deploy innovative image processing systems.
